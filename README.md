# Farm Simulation Engine

This project aims to build a modular simulation engine for farm scenarios and beyond. It is designed around reusable nodes, a plugin system and declarative configuration.

See [project_spec.md](project_spec.md) for the full specification, architecture overview and roadmap.

An example configuration file `example_farm.json` demonstrates a minimal world setup loaded via the declarative loader.
